### Part 4: Advanced React Patterns

- context module functions: use `dispatch` from `React.context` and pass it to helper function exported from the context module ("overkill but useful in some cases", e.g. to encapsulate reducer logic)
- compound components implemented via `React.cloneElement` on children 
- compound components with shared context 
- prop collections and prop getters
- state reducer as IoC pattern
- combine default reducer logic with custom overload
- control props
